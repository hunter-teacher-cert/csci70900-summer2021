## Readme vs Readme

Wanna get rid of that README.md file in your work repo? Read on...

This is the sole content of the auto-generated README.md that ghclassroom gave you:

```
[![Work in Repl.it](img)](destination_URL)
```
It renders as the black replit button.

Here is the equivalent in org-mode markdown:

```
[[destination_URL][img]]
```

So, if you take the destination URL out of the .md file and put it inside the first pair of brackets, you are almost there...

Since the button image is the same for all your repos, you can just copy this, and insert your own destination url:

```
[[destination_URL][https://classroom.github.com/assets/work-in-replit-14baed9a392b3a25080506f3b7b6d57f295ec2978f6f33ec97e36a161684cbe9.svg]]
```

...and once you have verified you have a working button on your README.org page, you can git rm your README.md file and enjoy GOODCLEANLIVIN.
